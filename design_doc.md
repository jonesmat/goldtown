Experience Goals
-------
- Death should come quickly, but fairly.  


Prototype - Phase 1
-------
- Simple overworld, single screen.
- Three basic buildings: Prospector's Hut (for dropping off gold), Sheriff's Office (for dropping off bounty trophies), and Weirding Hut (respawn).
- Simple status UI: Cash amount, ... (anything else?)
- Single hit is death (cash drops on corpse, must be retrieved).
- Single basic gun (each shot deducts from cash and can go into debt), all enemies are 1 hit kills.
- Two enemies: one enemy that wonders eradically and will kill the player on contact, another enemy that shoots at the player once they're in range (slow projectiles).
